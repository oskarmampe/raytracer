This project is very simple to execute, as it does not contain many source files. First, compile the files

[userid@machine Assignment4RayTracer]$ make

This will make create a binary file called ray_tracer. Execute the file:

[userid@machine Assignment4RayTracer]$ ./ray_tracer

For Blinn-Phong I have chosen the following properties:

ambient = 0.2
diffuse = 0.3
specular = 0.9
specular coefficient = 16;

These material properties clearly show the effect of each lightning.
